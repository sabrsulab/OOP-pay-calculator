# OOP-pay-calculator
This program uses object-oriented programming to calculate various aspects of a person's weekly pay (it cannot do more than one week at a time due to limited programming functionality).
The program takes inputs from the user, via the class in the python file titled 'weiners.py' to perform the various pay calculations, then returns the calculated weekly quantities to the user.
